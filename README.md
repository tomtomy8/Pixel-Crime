# Pixel Crime

A Pixel art came in which you fight crime on a national level. You will be able ot select an area in the country then
you fight a different sort of criminal depending on what sort of crime is most common there.

Once you have decided an area to fight in and you've entered a battle with a criminal you fight a side-scroller type 
brawler battle. Before entering battle you decide what sort of criminal to disgue as; different criminals attack 
differently. Defeating them will award you with in-game money. 

After defeating a certain amount of crimials in the area then you will face a boss - someone who is stronger and faster. 
Defeating them will mean you can become that class in battle.
